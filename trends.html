                  published in the Oxford Research Encyclopidias confirms this trend in the US.
                  The changes can be attributed to the human-induced climate change as well as 
                  anthropogenic factors, including urbanization and changes in agricultural practices.</P>

                    <P class="lead">There is a general decrease in the damage caused by floods contrary to the trend that we saw in the number of events. 
                        The first exception in 2003 was due to flooding in Fall River County, Shannon County, and Pennington county caused by heavy rain.
                        The second exception is 2006 due to the Mid-Atlantic flood which affected much of he mid-Atlantic region of the eastern coast of United States.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">The decrease after the 2006 event can be attributed to extensive efforts by FEMA and other organizations to reduce economic losses and threats to public health and safety from flooding.
                        Organizations have also made strides in preservation and restoration of the natural and beneficial functions and resources within floodpains.

                       The 2009 spike was becasue of the Las Vegas flooding when billions of gallons of rain fell over the valley. 
                       The spike in 2001 is caused by tropical storm Allison that devastated southeast texas in June of 2001. 
                       The 2010 Tennessee floods that were the result of torrential rains caused another spike in the number of injuries. 
                    </P>
                    <p class="lead">
                      On the other hand, the number deaths caused by flood events in the last 20 years have stayed consistent with a few exceptions.
                      The spike seen in 2011 can be attributed to hurricane Irene, tropical storm Lee, and other spring storms that devastated the US. 
                      The summer central floods (repeated high intensity storms in Texas), Autumn Appalachian Floods, hurricane Joaquin, and the winter floods 
                      resulted in a spike in the death roll in 2015.

                      <strong>WHAT NEXT? </strong>The increase in the flood events in the US is not only affecting the cummunities impacted but resulting in increased bill for the American Tax payer.
                      As a country, we need to evaluate what actions we are taking to manage the risk. This can mean changing policies and laws to align better with our changing climate,
                      reforming FEMA, and research to accurately map flood risk areas.
